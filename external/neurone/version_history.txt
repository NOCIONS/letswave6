Version 1.1.3.11 (2019-10-02)
- Updated revision support
- Matlab function nargchk is replaced to narginchk

Version 1.1.3.10 (2015-11-10)
Mega Electronics Ltd (mega@megaemg.com, http://www.megaemg.com)
- New feature: Supported new event port "Software". The name of the software component that
  generated the event is read from eventDescriptions.bin, if it's available.
- New feature: Supported new event types MEP (from eMotion Biolink) and response writer events.
- New feature: Supported main unit index and microsecond-precision time stamp. This differs from the
  field markers.time, which is calculated on the basis of data indexes. The new field markers.timeStampMicro
  can thus be more precise than markers.time.
- Renamed event type and port "Unknown" to "N/A".
- Event type and port are now separate fields markers.type and markers.port.

Version 1.1.3.9 (2015-06-01)
